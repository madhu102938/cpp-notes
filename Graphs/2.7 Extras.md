# Euler's Circuit Path
Euler's Circuit Path, a concept formulated by Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in the 18th century, relates to traversing a graph in such a way that every edge is visited exactly once, and the starting and ending vertices are the same. Euler's circuit path has significant implications in graph theory and network analysis.

Here's a brief overview of Euler's Circuit Path:

1. **Definition**: An Eulerian circuit or path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. If such a path exists, the graph is said to be Eulerian.

2. **Euler's Theorem**: Euler's theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an Eulerian circuit in a graph. According to the theorem, a connected graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if every vertex has an even degree.

3. **Algorithmic Implications**: Euler's theorem enables the development of algorithms to determine whether a given graph contains an Eulerian circuit or path. These algorithms often involve graph traversal techniques such as depth-first search or breadth-first search.

4. **Applications**: Eulerian circuits and paths find applications in various fields such as computer networking, circuit design, and transportation planning. For example, in computer networking, they can be used to optimize routing paths, while in circuit design, they aid in designing efficient electronic circuits.

5. **Generalization**: Euler's ideas have been extended to more complex structures, such as directed graphs (where edges have a direction), leading to concepts like Eulerian digraphs.

Overall, Euler's Circuit Path is a fundamental concept in graph theory that has practical implications in various domains, providing insights into the structure and connectivity of networks and aiding in the development of efficient algorithms.

```cpp
// This function takes in Adjacency Matrix and return a boolean expression
// The function checks whether it is possible to traverse each path in such a way that each edge is visited exactly once.
// It returns true if it's possible to do so, and false otherwise.

int isPossible(vector<vector<int>> paths) {
    // Loop through each path in the input vector
    for (vector<int> &path : paths) {
        // Calculate the sum of the vertices in the current path
        int sum = accumulate(path.begin(), path.end(), 0);
        // If the sum of vertices is not divisible by 2, implying an odd degree for some vertex,
        // return false as it's not possible to traverse each edge exactly once
        if (sum % 2 != 0)
            return false;
    }
    // If all paths have even sums of vertices, return true indicating it's possible to traverse each path satisfying the conditions
    return true;
}
