### Spanning Tree:
A spanning tree of a connected graph is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph while forming a tree-like structure. A tree is an acyclic connected graph. A spanning tree essentially "spans" or covers all the vertices with the least possible number of edges.

**Edge Weight:**
In some graphs, edges are associated with weights or costs. These weights can represent distances, costs, or any relevant metric.

### Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) 
Given a connected, undirected graph with edge weights, a minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree that has the **minimum** possible total sum of edge weights among all possible spanning trees.

Imagine you have a set of cities, and you want to connect them with roads, each with a different construction cost. The minimum spanning tree in this context would be the set of roads that connects all cities with the least possible total cost.
