- **Nodes** / Vertexes
- **Edges** (Lines between nodes)
- **Cycle** 
	- For a undirected graph, we need to look for a closed figure
	- For directed graph, we need make sure that arrow marks complete a closed figure
- **Path**
	- Going from one node to other through edges where we won't travel through the same node twice
- **Degree** - (for undirected) no. of nodes attached to it
	- Total degree of a graph is $2 * Edges$
- **Indegree** - For directed graph
	- No. of nodes pointing to a node
- **Outdegree** - For directed graph
	- No. of nodes pointing from a node
- **Edge weight** 
	- A graph sometimes has a number associated with the its edges
