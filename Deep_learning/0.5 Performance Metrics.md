Sure, let's define each of these terms:

True Positive (TP) = it is 1, classified as 1
True Negative (TN) = it is 0, classified as 0
False Positive (FP) = it is 0, classified as 1
False Negative (FN) = it is 1, classified as 0

1. **Precision**:
   Precision is a measure of the accuracy of positive predictions made by a classifier. It quantifies the number of true positive predictions divided by the total number of positive predictions made by the classifier. In other words, it answers the question: "Of all the instances predicted as positive, how many are actually positive?"

   *Precision = TP / (TP + FP)*

   Precision is particularly important when the cost of false positives is high. For example, in a medical diagnosis scenario, precision measures the proportion of patients correctly diagnosed with a disease among all patients diagnosed with the disease.

2. **Recall** (also known as Sensitivity):
   Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the ability of the classifier to correctly identify positive instances. It quantifies the number of true positive predictions divided by the total number of actual positive instances. In other words, it answers the question: "Of all the actual positive instances, how many did the classifier correctly predict?"

   *Recall = TP / (TP + FN)*

   Recall is particularly important when the cost of false negatives is high. For example, in a spam email detection system, recall measures the proportion of actual spam emails correctly identified among all spam emails.

3. **Sensitivity**:
   Sensitivity, also known as recall, is the same as the definition provided above. It's a measure of the ability of a classifier to correctly identify positive instances among all actual positive instances.

4. **Specificity**:
   Specificity is a measure of the ability of the classifier to correctly identify negative instances. It quantifies the number of true negative predictions divided by the total number of actual negative instances. In other words, it answers the question: "Of all the actual negative instances, how many did the classifier correctly predict as negative?"

   *Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)*

   Specificity is particularly important when the cost of false positives is high. For example, in a diagnostic test for a rare disease, specificity measures the proportion of healthy individuals correctly identified as negative among all healthy individuals.
