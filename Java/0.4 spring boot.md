# Inversion Of Control and Application Context / Dependence Injection
---
### **Inversion of Control (IoC) in Spring Boot**

**Inversion of Control (IoC)** is a design principle where the control of object creation, configuration, and management is transferred from the application code to a framework (in this case, Spring). It decouples the components of an application, allowing better modularity and easier testing.

---

### **How is IoC Achieved in Spring Boot?**

In Spring Boot, IoC is primarily achieved using the **Dependency Injection (DI)** mechanism. The Spring IoC container manages the lifecycle and dependencies of the application components (beans).

1. **Spring IoC Container**:
   - The IoC container is responsible for creating, configuring, and managing beans.
   - In Spring Boot, this is typically the **ApplicationContext**.

2. **Ways to Achieve Dependency Injection**:
   - **Using Annotations**: The most common way in Spring Boot.
     - `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`: Mark a class as a bean.
     - `@Autowired`: Inject dependencies automatically.
   - **Using XML Configuration**: Less common in Spring Boot (legacy approach).
   - **Using Java Config (`@Configuration`)**: Modern and flexible.

### **Example of IoC in Spring Boot**

#### **Step 1: Define a Service (Bean)**

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {
    public void performTask() {
        System.out.println("Performing task...");
    }
}
```

Here, `@Service` tells Spring to manage this class as a bean.

---

#### **Step 2: Inject the Bean into a Controller**

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class MyController {

    private final MyService myService;

    @Autowired
    public MyController(MyService myService) {
        this.myService = myService; // Dependency injected here
    }

    @GetMapping("/task")
    public String executeTask() {
        myService.performTask();
        return "Task executed!";
    }
}
```

Here, Spring:
1. Automatically creates an instance of `MyService` (IoC).
2. Injects it into the `MyController` using the constructor (`@Autowired`).

---

### **Spring Boot Simplifications for IoC**

1. **Component Scanning**:
   - Spring Boot automatically scans for beans in the package where the main application class resides (and its sub-packages).
   - Controlled using `@SpringBootApplication` or `@ComponentScan`.

2. **Auto-Configuration**:
   - Spring Boot provides many pre-configured beans for common use cases (e.g., `DataSource` for database connections).

---

### **Advantages of IoC in Spring Boot**
- **Decoupling**: Components are loosely coupled.
- **Easier Testing**: Mock dependencies can be easily injected.
- **Reusable Components**: Components managed by the container can be reused across the application.
- **Maintainability**: Centralized configuration and management.

---

### **Summary**
- IoC in Spring Boot shifts the responsibility of object creation and dependency management to the Spring IoC container.
- It is primarily achieved using annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Autowired`, and Java configuration.
- Spring Boot simplifies IoC by providing features like auto-configuration and component scanning, making it easier to build applications with minimal boilerplate code.

- @Springbootapplication
	- configuration - it tells that the class provides a configuration
	- auto configuration - it scans for all the dependences
	- componentscan - tells it to scan the application
- @Componenet - tells springboot to put this class in IOC container
- @RestController - same as Component, but comes with some extra functionality
- @Autowired - instead of created many instances of a class, we can just have one instance of it and shared among many classes that's what autowired does
- pom project object model
	- We can store our dependences here
- PathVariable, RequestParameter
- ORM - Object Relational Mapping
- JPI - Java Persistence API, it is guide lines and rules that an ORM tool should follow
- but JPA is only is only for Relational Databases
