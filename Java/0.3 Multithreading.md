### **Definitions**

1. **Core**:  
   The physical processing unit within a CPU that executes instructions independently. A multi-core processor can run multiple threads or processes simultaneously.

2. **Thread**:  
   The smallest unit of execution in a program, representing a lightweight sub-process that runs within a process and shares its resources.

3. **Multitasking**:  
   The ability of an operating system to execute multiple tasks (processes) simultaneously, improving system utilization and responsiveness.

4. **Multithreading**:  
   A programming technique where a single process executes multiple threads concurrently, enabling better utilization of CPU resources and faster program execution.

### **Time Slicing**

Time slicing is a CPU scheduling technique where the CPU's time is divided into small intervals, called time slices, and allocated to multiple threads or processes in a round-robin fashion.

This ensures that each thread gets a fair share of CPU time, enabling concurrent execution. However, the thread execution order is not guaranteed as it depends on the operating system's thread scheduler.

### **Difference Between Multitasking and Multithreading**

|Aspect|**Multitasking**|**Multithreading**|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|Running multiple processes simultaneously.|Running multiple threads within a single process concurrently.|
|**Execution Units**|Processes are independent and have separate memory spaces.|Threads are lightweight and share the same memory space within a process.|
|**Overhead**|Higher overhead due to process creation and context switching.|Lower overhead as threads share resources and context switching is faster.|
|**Communication**|Inter-process communication (IPC) is required, which is slower and more complex.|Threads can communicate directly since they share memory, making it faster and simpler.|
|**Use Case**|Suitable for running entirely separate applications (e.g., browser and text editor).|Suitable for tasks within the same application (e.g., downloading files and updating UI).|
|**Resource Usage**|Consumes more resources as each process requires its own memory and system resources.|Consumes fewer resources as threads share the same process resources.|

# Multithreading in java
- JVM and OS handle multithreading in java, in single core CPUs, they utilize time slicing to give the illusion of multitasking and multi-core CPUs can run real multitasking   
- Java supports multithreading through `java.lang.Thread` class and `java.lang.Runnable` interface

```java
package threading;

public class One {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()); // main
    }
}
```

- by default in the start we run on *main* thread

# Achieving multithreading in java
## Method 1
- We can do that we creating a class that extends `Thread` class and by overriding the `run` method and calling `start` method on the object

```java
// Two.java
package threading;

public class Two extends Thread {

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (;;) {
            System.out.println("World");
        }
    }
    
}

// One.java
package threading;

public class One {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Two two = new Two();
        two.start();

        for (;;) {
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }
    }
}
```

- We can just use a single class too
```java
package threading;

public class One extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (;;) {
            System.out.println("World");
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        One one = new One();
        one.start();

        for (;;) {
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }
    }
}
```

- thread in the main is called `main`, in Two class it is called `Thread-0`

## Method 2 of starting a new thread
- we need to create a new class that implements `Runnable` and override the `run` method
- Create an object of this class and pass it as an argument for the constructer of `Thread` object
- now call `start` method from `Thread` object
```java
// Two.java
package threading;

public class Two implements Runnable {

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (;;) {
            System.out.println("World");
        }
    }
    
}

// One.java
package threading;

public class One {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Two two = new Two();
        Thread t1 = new Thread(two);
        t1.start();

        for (;;) {
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }
    }
}
```

- In both these methods, `run` method has the code we need to run on an other thread

# Life cycle of a thread
The lifecycle of a thread in java consists of several states, which a thread can move through during its execution
1. **New** : created but not started
2. **Runnable** : after `start` method is called, thread becomes runnable, ready to run waiting for CPU time
3. **Running** : Executing
4. **Blocked/Waiting** : waiting for resources or waiting for another to perform action
5. **Terminated** : finished executing
in Java, *runnable* and *running* mean the same thing   

# Thread vs. Runnable
- If you need to create a thread of a class that is already inheriting from another class then we should use `Runnable` interface as java doesn't support multiple inheritance

# Thread methods
start, run, sleep, join, setPriority, interrupt, yeild, setDaemon
#### 1. **`start()`**

- Starts a new thread and executes the `run()` method in a separate thread of execution.
- **Example**:
    
    ```java
    class MyThread extends Thread {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Thread is running...");
        }
    }
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            MyThread thread = new MyThread();
            thread.start(); // Starts the thread
        }
    }
    ```
    

---

#### 2. **`run()`**

- Defines the task to be executed by the thread.
- Called automatically when `start()` is invoked, or directly (runs in the same thread if called without `start()`).
- **Example**:
    
    ```java
    class MyThread extends Thread {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Task running in: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
    }
    ```
    

---

#### 3. **`sleep()`**

- Pauses the current thread for a specified time (in milliseconds).
- **Example**:
    
    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
                try {
                    System.out.println("Thread sleeping...");
                    Thread.sleep(1000); // Sleep for 1 second
                    System.out.println("Thread awake!");
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    System.out.println("Thread interrupted during sleep.");
                }
            });
            thread.start();
        }
    }
    ```
    

---

#### 4. **`join()`**

- Waits for the thread to finish its execution.
- **Example**:
    
    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
            Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
                for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                    System.out.println("Thread count: " + i);
                }
            });
            thread.start();
            thread.join(); // Main thread waits for this thread to finish
            System.out.println("Thread finished execution.");
        }
    }
    ```
    

---

#### 5. **`setPriority()`**

- Sets the priority of a thread (ranges from `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY` to `Thread.MAX_PRIORITY`).
- **Example**:
    
    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thread thread = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Priority thread running..."));
            thread.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
            thread.start();
        }
    }
    ```
    

---

#### 6. **`interrupt()`**

- Interrupts a sleeping or waiting thread.
- **Example**:
    
    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(2000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    System.out.println("Thread interrupted!");
                }
            });
            thread.start();
            thread.interrupt(); // Interrupts the thread
        }
    }
    ```
    

---

#### 7. **`yield()`**

- Suggests the thread scheduler to pause the current thread and allow other threads of the same or higher priority to execute.
- **Example**:
    
    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
                System.out.println("Thread yielding...");
                Thread.yield(); // Suggests pausing
                System.out.println("Thread resumed.");
            });
            thread.start();
        }
    }
    ```
    

---

#### 8. **`setDaemon()`**

- Marks a thread as a daemon thread, which runs in the background and terminates when all non-daemon threads finish.
- **Example**:
    
    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
                while (true) {
                    System.out.println("Daemon thread running...");
                }
            });
            thread.setDaemon(true); // Mark as daemon thread
            thread.start();
            System.out.println("Main thread finished.");
        }
    }
    ```

# Synchronized
- go equivalent of `mutex` for java
- A **critical section** is a part of a program where shared resources like memory or files are accessed by multiple processes or threads. To avoid issues like data inconsistency or race conditions, synchronization techniques ensure that only one process or thread uses the critical section at a time.

```java
package threading;

class Counter {
    public int count = 0;
    public synchronized void increment() {
        this.count++;
    }
}

class MyTread extends Thread {
    public Counter counter;

    public MyTread(Counter counter) {
        this.counter = counter;
    }

    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            this.counter.increment();
        }
    }
}

public class One {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        MyTread t1 = new MyTread(counter);
        MyTread t2 = new MyTread(counter);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println(counter.count);
    }
}
```

### **Explanation of `synchronized` in the Code**

In this code, the `synchronized` keyword is used to ensure **thread safety** for the `increment` method in the `Counter` class. Here's how it works step by step:

---

### **What `synchronized` Does**

1. The `synchronized` keyword ensures that only **one thread** can execute the `increment` method at a time for a given instance of the `Counter` class.
2. When a thread calls a `synchronized` method:
    - It **acquires a lock** on the instance of the class (`this` in this case).
    - No other thread can access **any synchronized method** of that instance until the lock is released (i.e., the method finishes execution).
3. This prevents **race conditions**, where multiple threads try to modify a shared resource (e.g., `counter.count`) at the same time, leading to inconsistent or incorrect results.

---

### **How It Works in This Code**

1. **Shared Counter Object:**
    
    - Both threads `t1` and `t2` share the same `Counter` instance (`counter`).
    - Without synchronization, both threads might read the same value of `count`, increment it, and write the same updated value back, losing updates from one of the threads.
2. **Synchronized Increment:**
    
    - The `increment` method is marked as `synchronized`, so:
        - When `t1` calls `counter.increment()`, it acquires the lock on the `counter` object.
        - While `t1` is holding the lock, `t2` cannot access the `increment` method until `t1` releases the lock (i.e., exits the method).
        - This ensures that the `count` variable is incremented correctly, one thread at a time.

---

### **Without `synchronized`**

If the `increment` method were not synchronized, the two threads could simultaneously execute the method, leading to a **race condition**:

- Both threads could read the same value of `count` (e.g., 0).
- Both could increment it to 1 independently.
- Both could write the updated value back, overwriting each other's updates.
- The final `count` might not be 2000, but a smaller, inconsistent value.

---

### **Execution Flow in This Code**

1. A `Counter` object is created (`counter`), with `count` initialized to 0.
2. Two threads (`t1` and `t2`) are created, both sharing the `counter` object.
3. Both threads execute the `run` method, which calls the `increment` method 1000 times.
4. Because `increment` is synchronized:
    - Each thread takes turns incrementing the `count` variable.
    - The `count` variable is correctly updated one increment at a time, ensuring no updates are lost.
5. The `t1.join()` and `t2.join()` ensure that the main thread waits for both threads to finish.
6. The final value of `count` is printed, which will correctly be `2000`.

---

### **Key Takeaway**

The `synchronized` keyword is crucial in multithreaded programming to avoid race conditions when multiple threads access and modify shared resources. In this example, it ensures that the `count` variable is updated safely, producing the expected result of `2000`.

## other syntax for it

```java
public void increment() {
	synchronized (this) {
		this.count++;
	}
}
```

### **Explanation of `synchronized (this)`**

The syntax:

```java
synchronized (this) {
    this.count++;
}
```

is an alternative way of using the `synchronized` keyword to protect critical sections of code. Here's how it works:

---

### **What `synchronized (this)` Does**

1. **Explicit Lock on `this`:**
    
    - `this` refers to the current instance of the class.
    - When you write `synchronized (this)`, the thread acquires a lock on the current object (`this`) before entering the synchronized block.
    - While the lock is held, no other thread can enter any block or method synchronized on the same object (`this`).
2. **Scoped Synchronization:**
    
    - Unlike synchronizing an entire method (`public synchronized void increment()`), this approach synchronizes only the code inside the block.
    - This can be more efficient because only the critical section is synchronized, minimizing contention between threads.

---

### **How It Works in the Example**

#### Code:

```java
public void increment() {
    synchronized (this) {
        this.count++;
    }
}
```

1. When a thread enters the `synchronized (this)` block:
    - It acquires the lock on the current instance of the `Counter` class.
    - No other thread can execute any `synchronized` block or method that locks the same `Counter` instance.
2. Inside the block:
    - The thread increments the `count` variable safely, ensuring no other thread modifies it simultaneously.
3. When the thread exits the block:
    - It releases the lock on the `Counter` instance, allowing other threads to enter synchronized blocks or methods on the same object.

---

### **When to Use `synchronized (this)`**

1. **Fine-Grained Synchronization:**
    
    - If only part of a method (rather than the entire method) needs synchronization, `synchronized (this)` is preferable.
2. **Shared Resources Within the Same Object:**
    
    - When multiple threads need to access shared resources or variables within the same object (`this`), this syntax works well.

---

### **Comparison: `synchronized` Method vs. `synchronized (this)` Block**

|**Aspect**|**Synchronized Method**|**`synchronized (this)` Block**|
|---|---|---|
|**Scope**|Synchronizes the entire method.|Synchronizes only the code inside the block.|
|**Lock Held**|Acquires a lock on `this`.|Acquires a lock on `this`.|
|**Performance**|May cause unnecessary locking of unrelated code.|More efficient as it limits the synchronized section.|

---

### **Practical Example: Fine-Grained Synchronization**

#### Full Synchronized Method:

```java
public synchronized void increment() {
    this.count++;
    // Some unrelated code
    System.out.println("Increment done");
}
```

- Even the unrelated `System.out.println` line is synchronized unnecessarily.

#### Synchronized Block:

```java
public void increment() {
    synchronized (this) {
        this.count++;
    }
    System.out.println("Increment done");
}
```

- Only the critical section (`this.count++`) is synchronized, while other parts of the method execute without locking.

# Locks
### **Locks in Java: Overview**

The `Lock` interface (part of `java.util.concurrent.locks`) provides a more flexible and powerful mechanism for controlling thread access to shared resources compared to the `synchronized` keyword.

---

### **Why Use Locks Instead of `synchronized`?**
- Lets say we have a crictical section of code inside synchronized block and lets say that block lets a looong time to execute, until that time all other threads are effectively waiting, thus we can use something like `trylock()` instead of `synchronized` and do something else instead

1. **Fine-Grained Control**:
    
    - `Lock` provides better control over acquiring and releasing locks, allowing a thread to attempt acquiring a lock with timeout or interruption.
    - You can lock and unlock in different methods, unlike `synchronized`, which is limited to blocks or methods.
2. **Non-Blocking Attempts**:
    
    - With methods like `tryLock`, threads can avoid waiting indefinitely for a lock.
3. **Interruptibility**:
    
    - Threads can be interrupted while waiting for a lock, which is not possible with `synchronized`.
4. **Prevent Deadlocks**:
    
    - `ReentrantLock` allows advanced techniques to avoid deadlocks, like acquiring locks in a specific order.

---

### **Key Methods of `Lock` Interface**

1. **`lock()`**:
    
    - Acquires the lock, blocking if necessary until it’s available.
    - If multiple threads attempt to acquire the lock, one thread gets it.
    
    ```java
    lock.lock();
    try {
        // Critical section
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
    ```
    
2. **`unlock()`**:
    
    - Releases the lock.
    - Must be called in a `finally` block to ensure the lock is always released, even if an exception occurs.
3. **`tryLock()`**:
    
    - Attempts to acquire the lock without blocking.
    - Returns `true` if the lock is acquired, `false` otherwise.
    
    ```java
    if (lock.tryLock()) {
        try {
            // Critical section
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println("Lock not available");
    }
    ```
    
4. **`tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit)`**:
    
    - Attempts to acquire the lock, waiting for the specified time if it’s not immediately available.
    - Returns `true` if the lock is acquired within the time, `false` otherwise.
    
    ```java
    if (lock.tryLock(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
        try {
            // Critical section
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println("Could not acquire lock in 2 seconds");
    }
    ```
    
5. **`lockInterruptibly()`**:
    
    - Acquires the lock, but allows the thread to be interrupted while waiting for the lock.
    - Useful when a thread must stop waiting for a lock due to an external signal.
    
    ```java
    try {
        lock.lockInterruptibly();
        try {
            // Critical section
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        System.out.println("Thread was interrupted");
    }
    ```
    

---

### **ReentrantLock**

#### **What is ReentrantLock?**

A `ReentrantLock` is a class that implements the `Lock` interface and provides a thread-safe mechanism for locking. It is "reentrant," meaning the same thread can acquire the lock multiple times without causing a deadlock.

#### **Special Features**

1. **Reentrancy**:
    
    - If a thread that already holds the lock calls `lock()` again, it will succeed without blocking.
    
    ```java
    lock.lock();
    try {
        lock.lock();  // Same thread can acquire it again
        try {
            // Critical section
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
    ```
    
2. **Preventing Deadlock**:
    
    - ReentrantLock allows the same thread to reacquire the lock, avoiding self-deadlock situations.
    - Coupled with timeout and interruptible lock acquisition, you can prevent deadlocks more effectively.
3. **Fairness**:
    
    - `ReentrantLock` can be created as a fair lock using the constructor:
        
        ```java
        ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(true);
        ```
        
    - Threads acquire the lock in the order they requested it.
4. **Condition Variables**:
    
    - Allows threads to wait for certain conditions while holding the lock, enabling advanced concurrency patterns.

---

### **Example: Using ReentrantLock**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class ReentrantLockExample {
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void criticalSection() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is in the critical section");
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReentrantLockExample example = new ReentrantLockExample();

        Runnable task = example::criticalSection;

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task, "Thread-1");
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task, "Thread-2");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```
