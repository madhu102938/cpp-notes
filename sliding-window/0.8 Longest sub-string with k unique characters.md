Given a string you need to print the size of the longest possible substring that has exactly **KÂ unique** characters. If there is no possible substring then print -1.

```cpp
int longestSubstringWithKUniqueCharacters(string &s, int k)
{
    int high, low;
    high = low = 0;
    int n = s.size(), ans = 0;

    map<char, int> mp; // Map to store the count of each character

    while (high < n)
    {
        mp[s[high]]++; // Increment the count of the current character

        if (mp.size() < k) // If the number of unique characters is less than k
            high++; // Move the high pointer to the next character
        else if (mp.size() == k) // If the number of unique characters is equal to k
        {
            ans = max(ans, high - low + 1); // Update the maximum length of the substring
            high++; // Move the high pointer to the next character
        }
        else if (mp.size() > k) // If the number of unique characters is greater than k
        {
            while (mp.size() > k) // Remove characters from the substring until the number of unique characters becomes k
            {
                mp[s[low]]--; // Decrement the count of the character at the low pointer
                if (mp[s[low]] == 0) // If the count becomes zero, remove the character from the map
                    mp.erase(s[low]);
                low++; // Move the low pointer to the next character
            }
            if (mp.size() == k) // If the number of unique characters becomes k after removing some characters
            {
                ans = max(ans, high - low + 1); // Update the maximum length of the substring
            }
            high++; // Move the high pointer to the next character
        }
    }
	if (ans == 0)
		return -1;
    return ans; // Return the length of the longest substring with at most k unique characters
}
```
