Given a word **pat**Â and a text **txt**. Return the count of the occurrences of anagrams of the word in the text.

```cpp
// Function to search for occurrences of a pattern (pat) in a text (txt)
int search(string pat, string txt)
{
    // Length of the pattern and the text
    int k = pat.length();
    int n = txt.length();

    // Initialize low, high pointers for the sliding window and answer variable
    int low, high;
    low = high = 0;
    int ans = 0;

    // Create maps to store the frequency of characters in the pattern and the current window
    map<char, int> pattern, window;

    // Populate the pattern map with the frequency of characters in the pattern
    for (char ch : pat)
        pattern[ch]++;

    // Iterate through the text using a sliding window approach
    while (high < n)
    {
        // Expand the window by adding the current character to the window map
        window[txt[high]]++;

        // If the size of the window is less than the pattern size, continue expanding the window
        if (high - low + 1 < k)
        {
            high++;
        }
        // If the window size matches the pattern size
        else if (high - low + 1 == k)
        {
            // Check if the frequency maps of the pattern and window are equal
            if (pattern == window)
                ans++;  // Increment the answer count

            // Move the sliding window by removing the leftmost character
            window[txt[low]]--;

            // If the frequency of the removed character becomes zero, remove it from the window map
            if (window[txt[low]] == 0)
                window.erase(txt[low]);

            // Move both pointers to the next position
            low++, high++;
        }
    }

    // Return the final count of occurrences
    return ans;
}
```

- We can use Frequency array instead of map, for better complexity
