You are given an array of integersÂ `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return _the max sliding window_.

```cpp
vector<int> maxSlidingWindow(vector<int> &arr, int k)
{
    // Get the size of the input array
    int n = arr.size();

    // Variables to keep track of the sliding window's high and low indices
    int high, low;
    high = low = 0;

    // Using a deque to store elements in the current window
    deque<int> dq;

    // Vector to store the maximum elements for each window
    vector<int> ans;

    // Loop through the array
    while (high < n)
    {
        // Remove elements from the back of the deque if they are smaller than the current element
        while (!dq.empty() && dq.back() < arr[high])
            dq.pop_back();

        // Add the current element's index to the deque
        dq.push_back(arr[high]);

        // Check if the window size is less than k
        if (high - low + 1 < k)
            high++; // Expand the window
        else if (high - low + 1 == k)
        {
            // Window has reached size k, so store the maximum element in the window
            ans.push_back(dq.front());

            // If the maximum element in the window is at the beginning, remove it from the deque
            if (dq.front() == arr[low])
                dq.pop_front();

            // Move the window by incrementing both high and low indices
            high++;
            low++;
        }
    }

    // Return the vector containing maximum elements for each window
    return ans;
}
