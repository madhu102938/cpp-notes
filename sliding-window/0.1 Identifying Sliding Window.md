1. Given an **array** or **string**
2. Asking us to find maximum of minimum
3. given us the size of window (k) or telling to find the size of the window, which satisfies some set of conditions

### Boiler Plate for Fixed size Sliding Window
```
while (high < max_array_size)
{
	calculations

	if (window_size < max_window_size)
	{
		Extend the window
	}
	else if (window_size == max_window_size)
	{
		store answer

		Slide the window
	}
}
```


### Two types of sliding window problems
**1. Fixed size**
	1. Given us the size of the window and asking us to maximize or minimize under the given window
**2. Variable window**
	1. Given us some conditions, asking us to maximize or minimize the size of the window under certain conditions
