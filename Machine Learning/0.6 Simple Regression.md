y = b<sub>0</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>* x<sub>1</sub>
We use ordinary least square regression, meaning for the line we are generating, the errors^2 should be minimum of all the other lines we could have generated for that dataset

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
### Importing the libraries
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
regressor = LinearRegression()
```

### Fitting the curve
```python
regressor.fit(x_train, y_train)
```

### Using the curve to predict
```python
y_pred = regressor.predict(x_test)
```

### Plotting all this
#### Comparing model with train data
```python
plt.scatter(x_train, y_train, color='blue')
plt.plot(x_train, regressor.predict(x_train), color='red')
plt.title('Salary vs Experience (Training set)')
plt.xlabel('Years of Experience')
plt.ylabel('Salary')
plt.show()
```

#### Comparing model with test data
```python
plt.scatter(x_test, y_test, color='blue')
plt.plot(x_train, regressor.predict(x_train), color='red')
plt.title('Salary vs Experience (Training set)')
plt.xlabel('Years of Experience')
plt.ylabel('Salary')
plt.show()
```

here we can plot
```python
plt.plot(x_train, regressor.predict(x_train), color='blue')
```
or
```python
plt.plot(x_test, y_pred, color='blue')
```
These both would be same, those both use the same line equation thus we would get the same output

### Extras
1. Now comes the question, **How do we predict for some random value** lets say `12`
2. How do we find the coefficient and slope of the line we just created

1. To predict for some values we do this
```python
some_x = [[12], [13]]
some_y = regressor.predict(some_x)
```
Need to give the input as a 2d array

1. Find the the **Slope** (coefficient) and **Intercept**
```python
regressor.coef_
regressor.intercept_   
```


### Template
```python
# Training the Simple Linear Regression model on the Training set
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
regressor = LinearRegression()
regressor.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Predicting the Test set results
y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)
```
