```python
# Data Preprocessing Template  
  
# Importing the libraries  
import numpy as np  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
import pandas as pd  
  
# Importing the dataset  
dataset = pd.read_csv('Data.csv')  
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values  
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values  
  
# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set  
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)
```

- We won't have missing data in every dataset thus not required
- we won't categorial to encode each time
- future scaling is not mandatory

Thus this is a simple template with only the essential functions
