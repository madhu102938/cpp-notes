- Basically we take an event and make an assumption, it is called **Null Hypothesis** 
- For that event we will calculate the probability lets say (p)
- if `p < a`, then we reject null hypothesis, that means the assumption we took is wrong
- if `p >= a`, then assumption we made is statistically significant (i.e., it is possible)
- generally `a` is taken to be 0.05 meaning if the event has less than 5% chance of happening then the assumption is wrong
- Obviously we might take different values of `a` for different cases
