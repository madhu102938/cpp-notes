```
(A + B) % mod = (A % mod + B % mod) % mod

(A * B) % mod = (A % mod * B % mod) % mod
```
**But this doesn't work division** (only addition, subtraction, multiplication)

### Greatest Common Divisor
```cpp
int gcd (int a, int b)
{
    if (b == 0)
        return a;
    
    return gcd (b, a % b);
}
```

Even this is valid code for GCD, but this is not as efficient
```cpp
int gcd2(int a, int b)
{
    if (b > a)
        return gcd(b, a);
    
    if (a == 0)
        return b;
    
    return gcd(a-b, b);
}
```

### Divisibility by 9 and 3
If the sum of digits of the number are divisible by 9 or 3, then the number is divisible by 9 or 3 respectively

### Congruent
If `a` and `b` give same reminder with `n` then **`a` and `b` are congruent w.r.t to `n`**

#### Properties of Congruency
- **If `a` and `b` are congruent w.r.t `n` then `a-b` is divisible by `n`**

- **If `a` and `b` are congruent w.r.t `n` then `a^k` and `b^k` are congruent w.r.t `n`** 

**Q)** Find $29^{10}$ mod 3.
First `29 mod 3 = 2`
now using above property we can say `2^10 mod 3 == 29^10 mod 3`
`2^10 = 1024`
`1024 mod 3 = 1`
**ans : 1**
