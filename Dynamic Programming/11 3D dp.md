Initially, Alice is in the top-left position, i.e., (0, 0), and Bob is in the top-right place, i.e., (0, c-1), in the grid. Each of them can move from their current cell to the cells just below them. When anyone passes from any cell, he will pick all chocolates in it, and then the number of chocolates in that cell will become zero. If both stay in the same cell, only one of them will pick the chocolates in it.

**Recurrence** solution
```cpp
// Computes the maximum number of chocolates that can be collected starting from the given row and pair of columns in the grid
// Uses dynamic programming to avoid recomputing the same subproblems
// Returns the maximum number of chocolates that can be collected starting from the given row and pair of columns
int maxChocoUtil(int i, int j1, int j2, int n, int m, vector < vector < int >> & grid) 
{
  // Check if either column is out of bounds, and return a large negative value if so
  if (j1 < 0 || j1 >= m || j2 < 0 || j2 >= m)
    return -1e9;

  // If we have reached the last row, return the number of chocolates in the current cell(s)
  if (i == n - 1) 
  {
    if (j1 == j2)
      return grid[i][j1];
    else
      return grid[i][j1] + grid[i][j2];
  }

  // Loop over all possible moves for Alice and Bob, and compute the maximum number of chocolates that can be collected starting from the next row and pair of columns
  // Update the maximum number of chocolates that can be collected starting from the given row and pair of columns, and store it in the dp table
  // Return the maximum number of chocolates that can be collected starting from the given row and pair of columns
  int maxi = INT_MIN;
  for (int di = -1; di <= 1; di++) {
    for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; dj++) {
      int ans;
      if (j1 == j2)
        ans = grid[i][j1] + maxChocoUtil(i + 1, j1 + di, j2 + dj, n, m, grid);
      else
        ans = grid[i][j1] + grid[i][j2] + maxChocoUtil(i + 1, j1 + di, j2 + dj, n, m, grid);
      maxi = max(maxi, ans);
    }
  }
  return maxi;
}

// Initializes the dp table, and computes the maximum number of chocolates that Ninja can collect with the help of his friends by following the given rules
// Calls the maxChocoUtil() function with the initial row, and the columns of the first and last person
// Returns the maximum number of chocolates that can be collected
int maximumChocolates(int n, int m, vector < vector < int >> & grid) {
  return maxChocoUtil(0, 0, m - 1, n, m, grid);
}
```
***Time Complexity** - O($3^n * 3^n)$ : both Alice and Bob will be have three possibilities at every element*
***Space Complexity** - O($N$) : row size is the stack size*


**DP** solution
```cpp
// Computes the maximum number of chocolates that can be collected starting from the given row and pair of columns in the grid

```
***Time Complexity**: O$(N*M*M) * 9$
Reason: At max, there will be N*M*M calls of recursion to solve a new problem and in every call, two nested loops together run for 9 times.

***Space Complexity**: O($N$) + O($N*M*M$)
Reason: We are using a recursion stack space: O(N), where N is the path length and an external DP Array of size $N*M*M$.*



**Tabulation** solution
```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int maximumChocolates(int n, int m, vector < vector < int >> & grid) {
  // Write your code here.
  vector < vector < vector < int >>> dp(n, vector < vector < int >> (m, 
  vector < int > (m, 0)));

  for (int j1 = 0; j1 < m; j1++) {
    for (int j2 = 0; j2 < m; j2++) {
      if (j1 == j2)
        dp[n - 1][j1][j2] = grid[n - 1][j1];
      else
        dp[n - 1][j1][j2] = grid[n - 1][j1] + grid[n - 1][j2];
    }
  }

  //Outer Nested Loops for travering DP Array
  for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    for (int j1 = 0; j1 < m; j1++) {
      for (int j2 = 0; j2 < m; j2++) {

        int maxi = INT_MIN;

        //Inner nested loops to try out 9 options
        for (int di = -1; di <= 1; di++) {
          for (int dj = -1; dj <= 1; dj++) {

            int ans;

            if (j1 == j2)
              ans = grid[i][j1];
            else
              ans = grid[i][j1] + grid[i][j2];

            if ((j1 + di < 0 || j1 + di >= m) ||
              (j2 + dj < 0 || j2 + dj >= m))

              ans += -1e9;
            else
              ans += dp[i + 1][j1 + di][j2 + dj];

            maxi = max(ans, maxi);
          }
        }
        dp[i][j1][j2] = maxi;
      }
    }
  }

  return dp[0][0][m - 1];
}
```
***Time Complexity**: O($N*M*M)*9$
Reason: The outer nested loops run for (N*M*M) times and the inner two nested loops run for 9 times.*

***Space Complexity**: O($N*M*M$)
Reason: We are using an external array of size ‘$N*M*M$’. The stack space will be eliminated.*
