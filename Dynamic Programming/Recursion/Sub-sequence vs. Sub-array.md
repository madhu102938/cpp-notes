tabular form that summarizes the differences between subsequence and subarray:

|  | Subsequence | Subarray |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Definition | A sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. | A contiguous part of an array. |
| Order | The order of the elements must be preserved. | The order of the elements must be preserved, but they must also be contiguous. |
| Example | "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE", but "AEC" is not. | [2, 3, 4] is a subarray of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], but [1, 3, 5] is not. |
