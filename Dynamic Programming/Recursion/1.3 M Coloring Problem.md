Given an undirected graph and an integer **M**. The task is to determine if the graph can be colored with at most M colors such that no two adjacent vertices of the graph are colored with the same color. Here coloring of a graph means the assignment of colors to all vertices. Print 1 if it is possible to colour vertices and 0 otherwise.

```cpp
class Solution{
public:
    // Function to determine if graph can be coloured with at most M colours such
    // that no two adjacent vertices of graph are coloured with same colour.
    vector<int> colours = vector<int>(101, 0);
    
    bool isSafe(bool graph[101][101], int node, int color, int n)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            if (graph[node][i] == 1 && colours[i] == color)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    bool graphColoring(bool graph[101][101], int m, int n, int node = 0) {
        // your code here
        if (node == n)
            return true;
            
        for (int color = 1; color <= m; color++)
        {
            if (isSafe(graph, node, color, n))
            {
                colours[node] = color;
                if (graphColoring(graph, m, n, node+1) == true)
                    return true;
                colours[node] = 0;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
