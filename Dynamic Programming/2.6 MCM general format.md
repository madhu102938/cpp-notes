1. Probably a `string` or `array` is given, where you need to partition it
	1. Lets take two end points `i` (at start) and `j` (at end) and we need to break the list at `k` (which is between `i` and `j`)
	2. Now we recursively solve `i` to `k` and `k` to `j`
	3. increment `k` and recursively solve again
2. taking a minimum or maximum from all the solved answers

```cpp
int solve(int arr[], int i, int j)
{
	# Base Condition
	if (i > j)
		return 0;
		
	int ans;
	for (int k = i; k <= i; k++)
	{
		int temp_ans =  solve(arr, i, k) [operator] solve(arr, k+1, j);
		ans = [func](ans, temp_ans);
	}
	
	return ans;
}
```
- For **Base condition** generally think of the invalid case, like `i > j`, as in this case, there are no elements to partition, it can be something else too
- `[operator]` is `+ - * /`
- `[func]` is `min, max, etc..`
